# Platform Engineering Internship Program - Pentafox

## Introduction

Hello everyone,

I am thrilled to introduce myself as a participant in the "Platform Engineering" internship program at Pentafox. My name is V K Maniish Raja, and I am extremely excited to embark on this journey of learning and growth with such a dynamic and innovative organization.

I am currently pursuing my studies in B.Tech IT at Madras Institute of Technology [MIT], Chennai, India. As a passionate individual eager to explore the world of cloud computing and infrastructure management, I find myself continuously drawn to the possibilities that modern technologies offer in transforming the way we build, deploy, and manage applications.

During this internship, my primary focus will be on understanding cloud computing and gaining hands-on experience with platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure. I am particularly enthusiastic about the prospect of working with cutting-edge technologies and exploring how cloud services can enable scalable and efficient solutions for real-world challenges.

In this repository, I will be sharing my assignments, projects, and learnings related to cloud engineering and database connectivity using Python. Each submission will reflect my commitment to producing high-quality work and exploring innovative approaches to problem-solving.
